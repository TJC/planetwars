This is a Perl starter package for the http://ai-contest.com/ challenge.

You can run the example Perl bot straight away on your computer by just
running play_bot.sh
Alternatively, you can play with bots on the TCP server, which is better for
debugging, by using the play_tcp.sh script.

The Perl code was forked from https://github.com/ath88/planetwars, with some
modifications made to update the Perl coding style and make minor tweaks.
